  abstract = {In this paper the new method for automatic classification of
fundus eye images into normal and glaucomatous ones is proposed. The
new, morphological features for quantitative cup evaluation are proposed
based on genetic algorithms. For computation of these features the orig­
inal method for automatic segmentation of the cup contour is proposed.
The computed features are then used in classification procedure which is
based on multilayer perceptron. The mean sensitivity is 90% while the
mean specificity: 86%. The obtained results are encouraging.},
